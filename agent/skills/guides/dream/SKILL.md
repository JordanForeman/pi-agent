# Dream

You are running Jordan's nightly **learning synthesis** — the "dream" process.
You read the conversations Jordan has had with Pi since the last dream, extract
what is worth *codifying* into his skills/prompts, generalize it so it is safe
for a public repo, and propose it as **one PR he reviews**. You never edit `main`
directly, and you never commit raw work specifics.

## Invariants (do not violate)

- **Propose-only.** All changes land on a branch and a PR. Never commit to `main`.
- **Discretion is mandatory.** Every candidate learning passes through the
  `discretion` skill's generalization gate before it can be written. Load it.
- **Idempotent.** Re-running with no new sessions produces no PR and no churn.
- **Cross-machine.** State lives in the repo at `agent/.dream-state.json`,
  not in machine-local files. Advancing the cursor happens *in the PR*.
- **Bounded per run.** Never process more than `MAX_SESSIONS_PER_RUN = 40`
  transcripts in a single run. The corpus is hundreds of multi-MB sessions; an
  unbounded first run would spawn hundreds of subagents. The two-pointer
  watermark (below) makes capping safe — the next run continues where this one
  stopped, and nothing is ever stranded.
- **Context isolation.** Sessions are routinely 10–15 MB. NEVER read a
  transcript into this (the orchestrator's) context. Each transcript is ingested
  by a `dream-ingestor` subagent in its own context; you only ever see the
  distilled candidate learnings it returns.
- **Deterministic git.** You decide *what* to learn; let plain git/`gh` commands
  do branch/commit/PR. Delegate git operations to the `git-ops` subagent.

## Locations

- **Pi agent repo**: `~/Developer/pi-agent`. All edits + the watermark + the PR happen here. `cd` here first.
- **Session transcripts**: `~/.pi/agent{*}/sessions/**/*.jsonl` (multiple potential agents per workstation)
- **Watermark**: `agent/.dream-state.json` (per-profile cursor map).
- **Codified knowledge** (the edit targets): `agent/skills/{conventions,guides,formats,standards}/*/SKILL.md`.

## Transcript format (what you parse)

Each session is a JSONL file. The **first line** is
`{"type":"session","id":"<uuid>","timestamp":"<iso8601>","cwd":...}`. The
filename is `<iso8601-timestamp>_<uuid>.jsonl` (the timestamp uses `-` instead of
`:` so it is filesystem-safe). Subsequent lines include
`{"type":"message","message":{"role":...,"content":[{"type":"text","text":...}]}}`.

**Sort by the `timestamp`, never the `id`.** Older sessions use random UUID4 ids
(e.g. `79102b89-…`); newer ones use UUID7. Only UUID7 is time-sortable, so sorting
by `id` lets a high-lexical legacy UUID4 (e.g. `fe51…` from February) poison the
cursor and permanently exclude every later UUID7 session (`019…`). The header
`timestamp` field (and the equivalent filename prefix) is ISO8601 — lexicographically
chronological across **both** id formats. Use it.

**Only process top-level session files.** Skip nested subagent runs — any path
containing `/run-0/session.jsonl` or an intermediate hash dir is a subagent
transcript, not a conversation. Match only `sessions/<cwd-slug>/<timestamp>_<uuid>.jsonl`.
Also skip the currently running /dream session if it appears in the work set;
active transcripts are still being written and can create self-referential
learnings. Let the next run process that file once it is complete.

## Phase 0 — Memory-first recall

Use think tools to recall: prior dream runs, recently codified skills, and any
open dream PR. You want to avoid re-proposing things already learned.

## Phase 1 — Determine the work set (two-pointer, capped)

Each profile's state is `{ "cursor": <iso8601>, "floor": <iso8601> }`:

- **`cursor`** = highest timestamp already processed (the *new* edge).
- **`floor`** = lowest timestamp processed contiguously (the *old* edge).

The cap is `MAX_SESSIONS_PER_RUN = 40` (total across both profiles).

1. `cd ~/Developer/pi-agent` and read `agent/.dream-state.json`. (If you find the
   legacy v1 shape where a cursor is a bare string, treat that string as
   `cursor` and an empty `floor`.)
2. Enumerate top-level transcripts for both profiles, sorted by `timestamp`
   (newest first). For each profile, classify each session:
   - **forward** — `timestamp` strictly **greater than** `cursor` (new since
     last run). These are the priority.
   - **backfill** — `timestamp` strictly **less than** `floor` (older history not
     yet swept). Only relevant once forward work is exhausted.
3. Build the capped work set, newest-first, **forward before backfill**:
   take forward sessions (newest first) up to the cap; if room remains, fill
   with backfill sessions (newest first). **First run** (empty `cursor` *and*
   empty `floor`): every session is "forward," so you simply take the newest N.
4. If the work set is empty across both profiles: report "nothing new to dream"
   and **stop** (no branch, no PR). This is the idempotency guarantee.
5. If sessions remain beyond the cap, note the **pending count** per profile —
   you will surface it in the output so Jordan knows to re-run.

Why two pointers: "newest-first" means a single max-timestamp cursor would strand
all older history below it forever. Tracking both edges lets forward runs grab
new sessions immediately *and* lets backfill runs drain the old backlog over
subsequent nights — nothing is ever permanently excluded.

A reference enumerator (read-only; print profile, timestamp, id, path — sorted
newest-first). It keys on the header `timestamp`, **not** the `id`:

```bash
for prof in agent agent-shopify; do
  find "$HOME/.pi/$prof/sessions" -type f -name '*.jsonl' \
    ! -path '*/run-*/*' 2>/dev/null | while read -r f; do
      read -r ts id < <(head -1 "$f" | python3 -c \
        'import sys,json;h=json.load(sys.stdin);print(h.get("timestamp",""),h.get("id",""))' 2>/dev/null)
      [ -n "$ts" ] && printf '%s\t%s\t%s\t%s\n' "$prof" "$ts" "$id" "$f"
  done
done | sort -t$'\t' -k2 -r
```

## Phase 2 — Ingest transcripts via subagents (map step)

**Do not read transcripts yourself.** Sessions are 10–15 MB; reading one inline
would blow this context. Instead, for **each** session in the work set, delegate
to the `dream-ingestor` subagent, passing the absolute transcript path:

```
subagent { agent: "dream-ingestor", task: "Ingest this Pi session transcript and return distilled candidate learnings: <ABSOLUTE_PATH>" }
```

Fan these out in parallel where the harness allows (independent inputs), but
respect the harness's batch limits. If the map is larger than the allowed fanout
or a wave times out, chunk the work into smaller waves, keep completed
`DREAM_INGEST` blocks, and retry only the missing transcripts. Each subagent
reads its one transcript in an isolated context and returns only a small
`DREAM_INGEST` block (≤~400 tokens) of candidate learnings. You collect those
blocks — never the raw transcripts.

Then **reduce**: synthesize across all returned candidate blocks. This is where
cross-session signal emerges (the same correction or preference surfacing in
multiple `DREAM_INGEST` outputs). A candidate qualifies for the next phase only
if at least one holds:

- Jordan **explicitly corrected** the agent (preference or fact).
- Jordan expressed a **durable preference** about how work should be done.
- A pattern **recurred ≥2 times** across sessions (cross-session signal — the
  thing a per-session hook could never see).
- A **reusable technique** emerged that generalizes beyond its origin.

Reject: one-off task mechanics, project status, things already in a skill
(check Phase 0 recall + read the candidate's target skill). Optimize this pass
for *fidelity* — capture the real insight. Discretion comes next.

If the ingestor subagent is unavailable, fall back to a bounded extraction (text
only, never a full-file read) using the same JSONL-parsing approach the ingestor
uses — but the subagent path is strongly preferred for context safety.

## Phase 3 — Discretion pass (mandatory, separate)

Load the `discretion` skill and run **every** candidate through its generalization
gate as a distinct second pass. Keep / abstract / drop. Record a one-line
rationale for each DROP. After this pass, no candidate may contain an internal
system name, project codename, individual name, or work repo path.

## Phase 4 — Diff against existing knowledge

For each surviving learning, locate the right target:

- A **rule/constraint** → `conventions/`
- A **methodology** → `guides/`
- A **quality bar / taste** → `standards/`
- A **structured template** → `formats/`

Read the target SKILL.md. Decide: **new skill**, **amend existing skill**, or
**skip** (already covered). Prefer amending an existing skill over creating a new
one. Produce minimal, surgical edits — never blank-slate a skill file.

## Phase 5 — Apply edits + advance the watermark

1. Make the edits to the SKILL.md files.
2. Advance **both** pointers in `agent/.dream-state.json` per profile, using
   the timestamps actually processed this run:
   - `cursor` ← **max** of (current `cursor`, highest forward timestamp
     processed). If no forward sessions were processed, leave `cursor` unchanged.
   - `floor` ← on first run, the **min** timestamp processed; on a backfill run,
     the **lowest** backfill timestamp processed (drives the old edge downward).
     If only forward sessions were processed on a non-first run, leave `floor`
     unchanged.
   Keep `version: 2` and the `{cursor, floor}` object shape. Set `last_dream` to
   the current ISO date. Skip a profile entirely if it had no work this run.
3. Run the taxonomy validator and stop on any error:
   ```bash
   node agent/scripts/validate-taxonomy.mjs
   ```

## Phase 6 — One reviewable PR (amend if open)

Delegate to the `git-ops` subagent. Behavior:

- If an **open dream PR already exists** (branch `dream/learnings`), **amend it**:
  check out that branch, add the new commits, push. This consolidates multiple
  nights into one PR until Jordan reviews — avoids PR spam and merge thrash.
- Otherwise create branch `dream/learnings`, commit, push, open a PR.

Commit message: conventional, e.g. `chore(skills): codify learnings from dream <date>`.
PR body must include, per learning: the **generalized statement**, its **target
skill**, and **why** it qualified (correction / preference / recurrence). List any
DROPs with their rationale so the audit trail is visible. Never push to `main`.

## Output

A concise summary: count of sessions analyzed per profile (and whether each was
forward or backfill), learnings proposed (with targets), drops (with reasons),
the **pending count** per profile if the cap was hit (so Jordan knows to re-run),
and the PR URL (or "amended existing dream PR"). If nothing new: say so and stop.

## Headless / cron note

This skill is the single code path for both manual and (on personal machines)
cron-driven runs. On the work machine, run it manually inside an authenticated
session — the headless LLM-gateway token cannot refresh non-interactively. The
watermark makes cadence irrelevant: miss days and the backlog is preserved. Each
run is capped at `MAX_SESSIONS_PER_RUN`, so a large backlog drains over several
runs rather than one giant sweep — forward (new) sessions first, then backfill of
older history. Re-run until the output reports no pending sessions.
