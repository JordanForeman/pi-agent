description: Create a single high-signal commit from current changes
subagents: [git-ops]
---
Create one commit for the current changes.

Workflow:
1. Inspect repo state (`git status --short`, `git diff --cached`, then `git diff` if needed).
2. Draft a conventional commit message (subject + body) that explains why.
3. Ask for confirmation of the message and staged file scope.
4. Perform all git operations (stage, verify staged diff, commit) through your git specialist path.
5. Return commit hash, final branch, and post-commit status.

Constraints:
- Stage only intended files.
- Never amend unless explicitly requested.
- Never skip hooks unless explicitly requested.
- If there is nothing to commit, report it clearly and stop.
