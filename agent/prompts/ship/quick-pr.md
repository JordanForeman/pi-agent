subagents: [git-ops]

Prepare and publish the current work as a pull request.

Workflow:
1. Inspect branch/diff scope versus default branch and summarize what will ship.
2. Confirm branch/worktree safety (avoid main worktree for feature work).
3. Run or suggest relevant validation checks before publishing.
4. Perform all git operations (staging, commit creation, push) through your git specialist path.
5. Ask for confirmation before any network-visible action (push/PR create/edit).
6. Create or update the PR with:
   - short title
   - concise summary bullets
   - test/verification checklist
7. Return PR URL and a short summary of what was published.

Constraints:
- Keep commit/PR scope tight and intentional.
- Do not force push unless explicitly requested.
- Do not include secrets or unrelated files.
